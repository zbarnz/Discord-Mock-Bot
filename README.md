# Discord Mock Bot

This bot uses discord's API to interact with discord users once invited to the server. Using the command "!repeat (username)" will cause the bot to repeat everything that user says in the mocking spongebob case (e.g. spongebob to SpOnGeBob). The bot needs to be hosted on a server in order to keep it online at all times.
